# GraphQL Server Example with NestJS (code-first)

This example shows how to implement an **GraphQL server (code-first) with TypeScript** with the following stack:

- [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start): Web framework for building scalable server-side applications
- [**Prisma Client**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client): Databases access (ORM)                  
- [**Prisma Migrate**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate): Database migrations               
- [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html): Local, file-based SQL database

## Getting started

### 1. Download example and install dependencies


Install npm dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### 2. Create and seed the database

Run the following command to create your SQLite database file. This also creates the `Player` table that is defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

When `npx prisma migrate dev` is executed against a newly created database, seeding is also triggered. The seed file in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts) will be executed and your database will be populated with the sample data.


### 2. Start the GraphQL server

Launch your GraphQL server with this command:

```
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql) in your browser to explore the API of your GraphQL server in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).


## Using the GraphQL API

The schema that specifies the API operations of your GraphQL server is defined in [`./schema.graphql`](./schema.graphql). Below are a number of operations that you can send to the API using the GraphQL Playground.

Feel free to adjust any operation by adding or removing fields. The GraphQL Playground helps you with its auto-completion and query validation features.

### Create a new player

```graphql
mutation {
  createPlayer(data: { name: "Zangief", health: 12 }) {
    id
    name
    health
  }
}
```

## Evolving the app

Evolving the application typically requires two steps:

1. Migrate your database using Prisma Migrate
1. Update your application code

For the following example scenario, assume you want to add a "profile" feature to the app where users can create a profile and write a short bio about themselves.

### 1. Migrate your database using Prisma Migrate

The first step is to add a new table, e.g. called `characters`, to the database. You can do this by adding a new model to your [Prisma schema file](./prisma/schema.prisma) file and then running a migration afterwards:

```diff
// schema.prisma

model Player {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  name String
  remaining_health Int
+ characterId Int?
+ isActive Boolean?
}

+model Character {
+  id     Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
+  initial_health Int
+  bio    String?
}
```

Once you've updated your data model, you can execute the changes against your database with the following command:

```
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 2. Update your application code

You can now use your `PrismaClient` instance to perform operations against the new `Profile` table. Here are some examples:

#### Create a new character

```ts
const character = await prisma.character.create({
  data: { name: "Guile", initial_health: 10, bio: "Sonic Boom" }
});
```
